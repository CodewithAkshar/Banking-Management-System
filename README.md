# Banking Management System
The Banking Management System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate core banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and account deletion. Built using Core Java and integrated with a MySQL database via JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), the system ensures secure and efficient interaction between the application and the backend. It follows a structured, object-oriented design with dedicated classes for handling accounts, transactions, and database connectivity, ensuring clean code and separation of concerns. The system supports full CRUD functionality, offering persistent data storage for customer and account details while maintaining transactional accuracy and consistency. Robust input validation and exception handling are incorporated to prevent invalid transactions and ensure data integrity. This project serves as an excellent learning platform for beginners aiming to understand the fundamentals of Java, database operations, and backend logic in financial software. Potential enhancements include user authentication, transaction logs, audit trails, and GUI-based or web-based extensions for a more interactive experience.
